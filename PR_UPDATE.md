feat: Complete deployment system overhaul with centralized script

# PR Description

## ðŸš€ Complete Deployment System Overhaul

This PR introduces a comprehensive deployment and development management system for the T3 Turbo monorepo.

### âœ¨ Key Features

#### **Centralized Deployment Script (`scripts/deploy.sh`)**
- Process management with PID tracking
- Tunnel management (local tunnel + ngrok) with password handling
- Real-time status monitoring with process details and URLs
- Centralized logging for web, mobile, and tunnel outputs
- EAS and Vercel integration

#### **Package-Level Commands**
- **Next.js**: `deploy:local`, `deploy:vercel`, `deploy:tunnel`, `deploy:ngrok`
- **Expo**: `deploy:local`, `deploy:all`, `deploy:android`, `deploy:ios`, `deploy:tunnel`
- **Build Commands**: `build`, `build:android`, `build:ios` for EAS builds

#### **Root-Level Orchestration**
- Individual deployments using `pnpm -F` commands
- Combined workflows: `deploy:all:local`, `deploy:all:tunnel`, `deploy:all:build`
- Stop commands: `stop:web`, `stop:mobile`, `stop:all`

### ðŸ”„ **Major Changes**

- **New `scripts/deploy.sh`**: 1074-line deployment script with comprehensive functionality
- **Updated `DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.md`**: Complete documentation
- **Refactored `package.json` files**: Streamlined with focused deployment commands
- **Process & Log Management**: PID tracking, centralized logging, tunnel password handling
- **Development Workflow**: Expo Go mode, direct package commands, EAS/Vercel integration

### ðŸ“‹ **Command Examples**

```bash
# Development
pnpm deploy:all:local      # Start both web and mobile locally
pnpm deploy:all:tunnel     # Start both with tunnels
pnpm deploy:all:build      # Build both for production

# Individual
pnpm deploy:web:vercel     # Deploy web to Vercel
pnpm deploy:mobile:all     # Build mobile with EAS
pnpm stop:all              # Stop all services
```

### ðŸ“Š **Impact**
- **86 files changed** with comprehensive workflow transformation
- **Enhanced developer experience** with streamlined commands
- **Improved reliability** with proper process management
- **Complete automation** from manual processes to script-driven workflows

This overhaul transforms the development and deployment experience into a streamlined, automated system that scales with the monorepo architecture.
